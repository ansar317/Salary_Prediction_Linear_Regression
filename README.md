# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Salary Prediction model using Linear Regression for data science. The model is designed to predict salaries based on relevant features such as years of experience, education level, and other factors. This project serves as a practical example of applying linear regression in the context of salary prediction.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)
- Required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing information about individuals' salaries and relevant features. The dataset used can be found in the `data` directory.

## Data Exploration

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and relationships. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook (`data_exploration.ipynb`) for an interactive exploration of the dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features appropriately. Refer to the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook for detailed preprocessing steps.

## Model Training

Train the Linear Regression model on the preprocessed dataset to learn the relationships between features and salary. Refer to the `model_training.ipynb` notebook for the training process.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its predictive capabilities. Refer to the `model_evaluation.ipynb` notebook for detailed evaluation steps.

## Results

Explore the results of the model, including visualizations of predicted salaries compared to actual salaries.

## Usage

Use the trained model to make salary predictions for new data. Refer to the `usage_example.ipynb` notebook for an example of how to use the model for prediction.

## Dependencies

List of dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
